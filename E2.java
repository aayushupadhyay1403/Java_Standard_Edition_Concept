class E2{
    //Problem
    //int x = 2.35;
    //Narrowing conversion which is not allowed in java
    //(int) (double)
    //we can not directly assign the double into int data type. it is known as narrowing conversion which is not allowed in java
    //but after "Type-Casting"(forcefull conversion) we can assign double in int data type
    //solution
    //int x = (int)2.35;
